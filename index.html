             <p>I'm Neil, 35 years old (actually turning 36 this month). I got married 2 years ago and now am living in a small apartment in an eastern suburb in Sydney. I moved in Australia since 2006. After I completed a cookery course at TAFE, I became a professional chef. I dedicated my golden 10+ years to this profession and now I am in a second-in-charge role to manage a large-scale kitchen at a starred hotel. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, baking, snorkelling and gardening particularly into hydroponics. Recently I've built a small herb bed based on wicking concept at no cost, in which I used plastic containers from beef burger patties packages I found at work. My wife and I adopted two cats last year from Sutherland Animal Shelter. They are so adorable, and I have no resistance to anything that has fluffy fur. Great companions when you study at home! </p>
